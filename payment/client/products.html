    <small>Useful Information: Chatflix works anywhere in the world, and has no region restrictions. There are no ads on either of our servers; most content is available on both Server 1 and Server 2, but occasionally an item will be on one but not the other. Both servers have been certified 100% ad-free by our team. Server 1 has subtitles (captions) in a wide variety of languages for most content. Unfortunately, server 2 does not. In general, we recommend you always try server 1 first, as it has more content and tends to be slightly faster.<br /><br />Copyright Policy: We do not host any streaming content ourselves. Server 1 and Server 2 are operated by independent companies who act as "wholesale" providers of properly licensed, high performance, video streams. You pay us, we pay the content providers, content providers pay the hollywood studios, studios pay the lawyers, actors pay their divorce attorneys, and so on... You're getting a damn good deal when you think about it. But seriously. You don't need to worry about using a VPN or getting in trouble for watching streams on this site - there's no torrents, nothing to download, and no P2P - which means no viruses, no malware, and no DMCA takedown notices for you, our amazing customers. Are you from the DMCA? Well, we're not a content hosting company, but if you really want to give us a takedown notice, we will make sure it gets to the right people. Our address is at 100 Glacier Ave, McMurdo Station, Antarctica - we don't accept email due to bandwidth costs, so please send all messages as special maritime freight on an appropriate research vessel. If you wish to serve us with legal documents, you must do so on skis; motorized vehicles scare the penguins. Ciao</small>
